# What Strategies Can get us more Donations?
The most difficult aspect of Analysis is always about "HOW TO START".

In real life where you are asked to find the reason for a particular problem and all you're given is just access to a database, It can be overwhelming. Writing the SQL Queries may no be the problem here but constructing important questions to help you solve the problem.

This particular project took me quite some days to navigate, especially cracking the "Root-cause Analysis" aspect after querying the data from the #Database.

It would have been different if there was enough quantitative data points in the #dataset but the reverse was the case, There was only one quantitative column among 16 others after performing the #joins

More Issue because by the time I started researching about How to conduct #rootcause Analysis with Tableau, I found very little or no practical information or example online till I developed a practical approach myself.

Getting and validating the first question, that could lead to another 4 question with just one quantitative column was really challenging... Of course that's the major foundation of Root-cause Analysis.

After conducting the Root-cause, I finally did other supporting analysis to aid the decision makers

After using #Tableau, I began to explore #Python pandas on this same project, my aim is to see if we can build a machine learning model to predict how much a donor will donate based on other qualitative features of a potential Donor but I'm not done with that.

However, my Tableau report can be found in this project

It's not first about the Aesthetics but the Valuable insight and action points for the Organization..
